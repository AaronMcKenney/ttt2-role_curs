The Cursed has no team and cannot win. They cannot deal damage. Death is impermanent as they will always resurrect. A player who has been afflicted must work to remove their Cursed status, which can only be done by changing roles. Two methods are provided to them: They can "tag" a different player by interacting with them, or they can shoot a different player with their RoleSwap Deagle. Both of these methods will swap roles between the two players, meaning that over time, everyones' roles will be shuffled. A former Cursed cannot be "tagged" (and may not harm the new Cursed player) until another role swap has occurred (i.e. "No backsies").
 
Think of it like a game of tag, if it makes you feel better.

Also you can press "V" to set yourself on fire. Use this to respawn at worldspawn if you happen to die, or to set yourself on fire.

Convars are variables that are introduced to allow server owners to customize the gameplay without changing the code. There are always a handful of convars automatically created by TTT2, that define the spawn parameters of this role and are found in ULX. Additionally there might be some role specific convars, which have to be set in the server config file.
